              We invite school students to join us for an exciting and
              educational event at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad
              (IITH) campus on December 17, 2024. This fun-filled day is
              designed to inspire young minds by offering hands-on workshops,
              engaging activities, and interactive learning sessions. Students
              will have the opportunity to explore various STEM fields, such as
              robotics, coding, and renewable energy, while also participating
              in team-building and creative workshops. By combining education
              and entertainment, we aim to create an unforgettable experience
              that fosters a passion for learning and encourages students to
              reach their full potential. Join us for a day of discovery and
